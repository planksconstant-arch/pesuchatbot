Nexus AI Gateway üöÄ
A dynamic, multi-LLM gateway that intelligently routes queries to the best model for the job.
</div>

About The Project
Nexus AI Gateway is a single API that connects to multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional setups that rely on one provider or use a simple fallback, our approach proactively switches between LLMs based on the specific task.

This system analyzes the user's query to determine its nature‚Äîbe it creative, technical, or emotional‚Äîand routes it to the most capable model, ensuring the highest quality response every time.

‚ú® Key Features
üß† Intelligent Task Routing: A unified API call automatically selects the best LLM (e.g., GPT-5 for business, Claude for empathy) based on the query's context.

üé≠ Dynamic Persona Switching: Users can instantly change the AI's tone and style‚Äîfrom a technical tutor to an emotional guide‚Äîfor a tailored interaction.

üîä Multilingual TTS Support: Features Text-to-Speech with auto-speak functionality in both English and Kannada, making the application accessible to a wider audience.

ü§ñ Automated Knowledge Aggregation: Uses an n8n workflow to fetch and summarize the best answers for student-related questions from sources like Reddit and Discord.

üîå Future-Proof & Extensible: Designed to seamlessly integrate new and emerging LLMs without system overhauls.

How It Works
Nexus AI is not a fallback system; it's a strategic router. It actively chooses the strongest model for each category to leverage the best of all worlds.

Proactive Model & Persona Switching
The gateway identifies the user's intent and selected persona to route the request to the optimal model.
